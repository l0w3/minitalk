# libft

This is the very first ðŸ¥‡ project of 42's Common Core Cursus, where we have to create our own library that we will be allowed to use on future projects. To create this library we couldn't use any other functions but ``write`` from the library ``unistd.h`` and ``malloc`` from ``stdlib.h``. The use of other libraries was enough to fail the project. 

While creating this project I learned a lot about library cretion, Makefile, how to propperly read and understand documentation of functions and also how many programmes really worked. Defenetely will use many of the functions I created here on future.
