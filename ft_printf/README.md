# ft_printf

This project just asked to recreate another function, but this time one more coplex than the ones implemented in [libft](https://github.com/AlexadeZ17/libft).

``ft_printf`` is a recreation of the behaviour from the original function ``printf`` from the ``stdio.h`` library. The learning insights from this project were how to use variadic functions, make code modular an protecting code (error handling). It was really exciting to finish it and deeply understand a function I've always used without having any idea of what it implemented.
